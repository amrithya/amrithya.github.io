Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello there, I'm a graduate in MSc Machine Learning and Data Mining from Université Jean-Monnet (UJM), Saint-Étienne, France. My main focus was on interpretable and sustainable AI, developing transformer and graph-based models for biological and scientific data. I’m passionate about creating transparent, efficient, and impactful machine learning solutions across disciplines. I love working on interdisciplinary projects and exploring scientific questions.
